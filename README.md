## StudioForty9 Front-end Recruitment Test

Thank you for investing the time to take our technical test. The test consists of two parts:

1. A coding test
2. A few technical questions

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared Google Drive folder. 
In order to obtain the URL for this folder, please supply your Gmail or Google-based email address to the StudioForty9 team member who assigned you this test.

Please make this a single zip file named `{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip` containing:

1. [One folder containing the coding test and clear instructions on how to implement it on a theme, e.g. Dawn, Craft or Sense](#coding-test)
2. [A single markdown file with the answers to the technical questions](#technical-questions)

### Task Requirements

There is no time limit or requirement on this test. 
We would suggest spending no more than two to three hours on your submission. However, you are free to spend as much or as little time as you like as long as the test requirements are met.
We also consider the technical questions an integral part of the test and an opportunity for you to explain what you would like to have added to your submission given more time.

### Coding Test

* Using [Shopify's Section Rendering API](https://shopify.dev/api/section-rendering) create a quick view / quick shop module for a store regardless of the theme used.
* Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up using any combination of HTML, CSS, Liquid and JavaScript
* The design of the module is up to you, but consider:
* The module should work on collection pages of up to 24 products as well as in featured product carousels across the store
* The module should function for users on all devices without replacing the product page
* Feel free to use whatever libraries or frameworks you like. Use of Tailwind CSS is a plus
* Consideration will be given to page load speed and the effect on CWV scores

### Technical Questions

* How long did you spend on the coding test?
* What would you have changed or added given more time?
* What is your favourite type of front-end project, language or framework to work on?

Thank you for your time, we look forward to your application.
