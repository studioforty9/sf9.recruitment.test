### Task Requirements

There is no time limit or requirement on this test. 
We would suggest spending no more than two to three hours on your submission. However, you are free to spend as much or as little time as you like as long as the test requirements are met.
We also consider the technical questions an integral part of the test and an opportunity for you to explain what you would like to have added to your submission given more time.

### Coding Test

* Create a quick view / quick shop module for a Shopify store regardless of the theme used
* The design of the module is up to you, but consider:
* The module should work on collection pages of up to 24 products as well as in featured product carousels across the store
* Consider how the module will be meaningful and function for desktop, tablet and mobile (Android and iOS) users
* The module should expand on the information available without replacing the product page. Suggestions:
    * Availability
    * Sizes/colours
    * Imagery
    * More information or other call to action
* Feel free to use whatever libraries or frameworks you like
* Consideration will be given to page load speed and the effect on CWV scores
* Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up

### Technical Questions

* How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you have changed or added given more time?
* List some of your preferred JavaScript frameworks and tell us for which situations you would use or not use each one
* How would you debug a performance issue in production and have you ever had to do this?

Thank you for your time, we look forward to your application.
