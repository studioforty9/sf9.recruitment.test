## StudioForty9 Front-end Recruitment Test

Thank you for investing the time to take our technical test. The test consists of two parts:

1. A coding test
2. A few technical questions

In order to avoid bounced emails we would like you to submit your results by uploading the relevant zip file to a shared Google Drive folder. 
In order to obtain the URL for this folder, please supply your Gmail or Google-based email address to the StudioForty9 team member who assigned you this test.

Please make this a single zip file named `{yourname}-{role-applied-for}.zip` containing:

1. [One folder containing the coding test](#coding-test)
2. [A single markdown file with the answers to the technical questions](#technical-questions) and
3. A link to a demo Shopify store with the module installed. Please include admin access to the store.

### Task Requirements

There is no time limit or requirement on this test. 
We would suggest spending no more than two to three hours on your submission. However, you are free to spend as much or as little time as you like as long as the test requirements are met.
We also consider the technical questions an integral part of the test and an opportunity for you to explain what you would like to have added to your submission given more time.

### Coding Test

* Using [Shopify's Section Rendering API](https://shopify.dev/api/section-rendering) create a [quick view / quick shop](#what-is-quick-view) module for a store regardless of the theme used.
* Use semantic, accessible and valid mark-up using any combination of HTML, CSS, Liquid and JavaScript
* Feel free to use whatever libraries or frameworks you like. Use of Tailwind CSS is a plus
* The design of the module is up to you, but consideration will be given to:
    * How the module works on product cards across the store
    * How the module functions for users on different devices
    * How page load speed and other CWV metrics are affected

### What is Quick View

A ’quick view’ is an ecommerce feature designed to allow the user to see more details and images for a product via an overlay, whilst on a product listings page (PLP). The idea is that the user gets a peek into more content whilst still being on the PLP and not lose their place browsing.

### Technical Questions

* How long did you spend on the coding test?
* What would you have changed or added given more time?
* What is your favourite type of front-end project, language or framework to work on? And why?

Thank you for your time, we look forward to your application.
